# Woodall P03 — fusion1

## Environment

- Branch: `runs/P03-fusion1`
- Python: Python 3.10.12
- PySAT: `python-sat 1.9.dev7` (Glucose3 smoke test passed)
- NetworkX: `3.4.2`
- PyPy: PyPy 7.3.9 / Python 3.8.13
- nauty: 2.7r3; binaries are `/usr/bin/nauty-geng` and
  `/usr/bin/nauty-directg` (the unprefixed `geng`/`directg` names are absent)

## Port

The v5 phase-2 scripts were copied from `origin/runs/P03-v5`:
`orient_exhaust.py`, `prep_graphs.py`, `enum_pypy.py`, `harness.py`,
`crosscheck.py`, `sat_check.py`, and the supporting search/exhaustion and test
scripts.

## Checker validations

All validations below passed on 2026-07-24:

- `test_harness.py`: all sanity tests passed.
- `crosscheck.py`: independent brute-force checker agreed with the PySAT
  harness on 40/40 random tau=3 instances.
- `test_exact_pack.py`: pure-Python exact packer agreed with PySAT on 300
  n=14 candidates; random-DAG cross-check agreed on 21 instances (0
  non-packing instances in that sample).
- `test_cegar.py`: CEGAR packer agreed with pure exact backtracking on 400/400
  n=14 candidates and with PySAT on 60/60 random tau>=3 DAGs.
- `test_dicut_filter.py`: reduced-dicut filter agreed with brute force on
  500/500 candidates.

The fixture files used by the v5 tests were regenerated in `/tmp` from the
tracked v5 `kept14.jsonl`; they are not part of the repository.

## n=16 exhaustion

Pending / in progress. Logs and shard outputs are kept in this directory.
